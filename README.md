## Error Handling
The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Here's a list of common error codes:

Status Code	Meaning	Description
400	Bad Request	The request was invalid or cannot be served.
401	Unauthorized	Authentication failed. API key missing or invalid.
403	Forbidden	You don’t have permission to access this resource.
404	Not Found	The requested resource doesn’t exist.
500	Internal Server Error	A generic error occurred on the server.

Use try/catch blocks or response interceptors to gracefully handle errors in your application.



## Usage Limits and Best Practices
Rate Limits
1000 requests/day for Free Tier users

10,000 requests/day for Pro users

Requests exceeding the limit will return 429 Too Many Requests.

Best Practices
Cache responses whenever possible to minimize repeated requests.

Handle rate-limiting by implementing exponential backoff.

Secure your API keys and avoid exposing them in public repositories.

Monitor API usage to stay within rate limits.
